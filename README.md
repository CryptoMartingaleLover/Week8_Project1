Core Messages
- In a downward market, there are still areas where investors can find hedges and capture gains during the downturn. 

Hypothesis
Technology, Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Healthcare will be sectors that can survive market downturns and a place where investors can hedge against a major downturn.
